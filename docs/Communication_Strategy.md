# Communication Strategy

Being a key component of our software maintenance simulation, Communication is always a prominent factor in a team based development environment. Since we were simulating a real-world team structure, we needed to stay organized, aligned, and responsive across all three support tiers.

As the team lead and Tier 3 engineer, I made it a priority to ensure that every issue we handled was accompanied by clear communication — whether it was resolving it at one tier or escalating it to another.

## Tools and Techniques We Used

While this was a simulation, we modeled our communication on industry-standard practices:
- **Real-time online meetings** to make collective decisions quickly.
- **Role-specific updates** shared after initial assessments.
- **Verbal check-ins** for alignment before escalation.
- **Clear documentation of escalation notes**, resolution steps, and decisions in the issue log.

## Cross-Tier Collaboration

We made sure each tier communicated effectively:
- **Tier 1 (Nephas)** reported observations in plain language and tagged patterns for Tier 2.
- **Tier 2 (Rayford)** added technical assessments and flagged unclear results early.
- **Tier 3 (myself)** clarified escalation justifications and led discussions on patching or deeper debugging.

I encouraged everyone to speak up when they felt stuck, and emphasized that **fast, honest updates were better than quiet guessing** — a principle we followed closely.

## Communication Challenges

Like in the real world, we faced a few coordination hurdles:
- There were moments when **uncertainty about escalation thresholds** led to delays (like in Ticket 3).
- Sometimes, **not everyone was on the same page immediately**, especially in interpreting bug scope or triage urgency.
- The lack of an automated dashboard made **prioritization a manual process**, which caused some friction.

## What Worked Well

- We maintained a **chain of communication**, even when an issue moved tiers.
- Our **role-based approach** helped reduce noise — each tier had clear responsibility.
- We learned the importance of **clarifying assumptions early** to avoid wasted time.

Effective communication ensured that even when a ticket was passed from Tier 1 to Tier 3, the context wasn’t lost. In a real production environment, this same discipline helps avoid duplicated effort and accelerates resolution timelines.

By simulating real-time collaboration and escalation handoffs, we sharpened our skills in clear, structured communication — which is critical in any maintenance or DevOps role.
