Software Maintenance Simulation – A real world Scenario.

About This Lab

This repository is based on a real-world software maintenance simulation conducted to show case software Maintenance knowledge. The lab was designed to mimic common challenges encountered in live production systems, such as bug reports compatibility issues and misaligned deployments.

Our task involved reviewing multiple software issues of varying severities, organizing into support tiers (Tier 1–3), triaging tickets, deciding when and how to escalate, and documenting our resolution strategy. The focus was not on writing code, but on demonstrating analytical thinking, process management, and technical communication — core elements of software maintenance.

Purpose of This Repository

This repo demonstrates my ability to analyse, triage, and resolve real-world software maintenance tickets without writing code. It showcases my understanding of:

- Tiered support structure
- Issue prioritization and escalation logic
- Communication strategy in high-pressure situations
- Dependency management and security patching
- Team coordination and leadership during maintenance cycles
