# Lessons Learned

Throughout this software maintenance simulation, we gained firsthand insight into what it takes to manage real-world production issues as a structured engineering support team. From technical diagnosis to team dynamics, the experience helped us sharpen both our problem-solving and communication skills.

## Technical Lessons

- **Escalation saves time.** It’s better to escalate early than to let a ticket linger in the wrong tier. Time is critical during production issues, and indecision can delay solutions.
- **Surface-level bugs can hide deeper problems.** For example, a seemingly small 404 error or payment failure could indicate routing problems or third-party integration breakdowns.
- **Security and dependency audits are ongoing responsibilities.** CVEs like the one in Ticket 8 reminded us that dependency management is a proactive task, not a one-time setup.
- **Performance issues need context-aware investigation.** Slowness in the dashboard wasn't just about bad UI — it stemmed from underlying data-fetching inefficiencies.

## Teamwork Lessons

- **Clear role distribution leads to clarity.** Having each person own a specific tier meant faster action and less second-guessing.
- **Communication must be continuous and structured.** Team check-ins and real-time updates prevented confusion — especially when working with overlapping issues.
- **Misalignment costs time.** Our delay in escalating Ticket 3 showed us that even short hesitation can impact resolution speed.
- **Leadership is about balancing clarity with flexibility.** As the team lead, I learned that while planning is key, being able to pivot quickly is even more important.

## Final Thought

Maintenance isn’t just about fixing bugs — it’s about keeping systems healthy, users happy, and teams coordinated. This simulation helped us think like real engineers, preparing us to handle live system issues with structure, urgency, and care.
